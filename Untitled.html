		<br>Im tired,
		<br> of trying self improvement,
		<br> of my stagnant mundane lifestyle,
		<br> of hating everyone,
		<br>of hating myself,
		<br>of loving myself,
		<br>of modern society,
		<br>of remembering her,
		<br>of the mentality of people,
		<br>of feeling powerless,
		<br>of my past,
		<br>of my present,
	    <br>of	life choices,
		<br>of waking up,
		<br>of expectations,
		<br>of failed expectations,
		<br>of loneliness,
		<br>of paranoia,
		<br>of anxiety,
		<br>of money,
		<br>of slow time,
		<br>of fast time,
		<br>of no appetite,
		<br>of not knowing anything,
		<br>of knowing too much,
		<br>of ignorance,
		<br>of social media,
		<br>of feelings,
		<br>of lack of feelings,
		<br>of just about of fucking everything,

		<br>Maybe what we say when we go isn't as important <br> as what others say about us. take the nicest thing someone will say about you <br> and the worst thing and somewhere in the middle is who you are <br> or maybe words aren't enough to define a life<br> maybe only ones actions can. <br>
